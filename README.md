## Overview<a name="overview"></a>

Welcome to the "Employee Retention Prediction" project repository. This project aims to predict employee retention using data analytics and machine learning techniques. High employee turnover can be costly and disruptive, and this project provides a solution to help organizations identify and retain valuable employees.

## Project Description<a name="project-description"></a>

Employee retention is a critical concern for organizations. High turnover rates can lead to increased recruitment and training costs and may disrupt the company's operations. Predicting which employees are likely to leave the organization can provide valuable insights for proactive retention strategies.

In this project, we analyze a dataset containing information about employees, such as job satisfaction, performance evaluation scores, number of projects, average monthly hours worked, years spent at the company, work accidents, promotions, department, and salary. We use this data to build predictive models that forecast employee departures.

The project includes the following steps:
- Data preprocessing and exploration.
- Feature engineering to identify key predictors.
- Building and evaluating machine learning models for retention prediction.
- Generating insights and recommendations for employee retention strategies.

## Dataset<a name="dataset"></a>

The dataset used in this project contains employee-related information, including:

- **satisfaction_level**: Employee-reported job satisfaction level [0–1].
- **last_evaluation**: Score of the employee's last performance review [0–1].
- **number_project**: Number of projects the employee contributes to.
- **average_monthly_hours**: Average number of hours the employee worked per month.
- **time_spend_company**: How long the employee has been with the company (in years).
- **Work_accident**: Whether or not the employee experienced a work accident.
- **left**: Whether or not the employee left the company (target variable).
- **promotion_last_5years**: Whether or not the employee was promoted in the last 5 years.
- **Department**: The employee's department.
- **salary**: The employee's salary (in U.S. dollars).

## Project Structure<a name="project-structure"></a>
